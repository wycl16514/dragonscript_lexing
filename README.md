when we programming, we have to use given lanague to write lots of strings in a given file, for example following is a piece of js code:

```js
let x = 1
let y = 2
let z = x + y
let hello = "hello"
let word = "word!"
let hello_word = hello + word
```

but be noticed, such kind of code is humman facing, which meas it is readable for human but not for machine. machine can only recoginze numbers not strings, and we need to transfor
this strings into number, this process is called lexing.
